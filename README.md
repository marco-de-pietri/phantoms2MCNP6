# phantoms2MCNP6
Tools for the manipulation and anlysis of Unstructured Meshes phantoms and integration in MCNP6

The tools contained in this repo provide the following features:

1. voxelize an unstructured mesh, and write an MCNP input file with the resulting voxel phantom
2. write the flux and/or energy deposition tallies within voxel or UM phantoms in vtk files for an easy evaluation with ParaView or other softwares. 
3. Compare dose distributions from two different simulations within the same phantom. The phantoms may be voxelized or not!
